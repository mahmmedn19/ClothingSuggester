# Clothing Suggester App
The Clothing Suggester App is a mobile application designed to help users quickly and easily choose appropriate clothing to wear based on the weather conditions of their city. The app allows users to upload images of their own clothing and uses a temperature-based algorithm to suggest outfits that are both weather-appropriate and personalized to their wardrobe.
